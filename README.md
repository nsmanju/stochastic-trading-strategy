A stochastic strategy relies on randomness and probabilities to make decisions about buying or selling stocks
The most common tool behind this approach is the Stochastic Oscillator, a popular technical indicator that helps traders spot when a stock might be overbought (price is too high and might fall) or oversold (price is too low and might rise).

Beginner-Friendly Explanation:

Stochastic = Randomness: The term "stochastic" comes from statistics and refers to something that involves a random probability or is unpredictable in the short term.

Stochastic Oscillator: In stock trading, the stochastic oscillator compares a stock’s closing price to its price range over a specific period (like 14 days). It produces a number between 0 and 100.

If the value is above 80, the stock is considered overbought (maybe time to sell).

If the value is below 20, the stock is oversold (maybe time to buy).

How Traders Use a Stochastic Strategy:

Look for signals: When the stochastic oscillator crosses certain thresholds (like above 80 or below 20), it gives buy or sell signals.

Not a guarantee: The signals are based on probabilities—not certainties. That’s why it’s called a “stochastic” strategy; outcomes are not perfectly predictable.

Combine with other tools: Smart traders often combine the stochastic strategy with other indicators to improve their chances of success.

In simple terms:
A stochastic strategy helps traders make decisions by using a tool that measures whether a stock is potentially too expensive or too cheap compared to its recent prices. It’s about using patterns and probabilities—never certainties—to try to make smart trades.
